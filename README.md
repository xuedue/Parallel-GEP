# Parallel-GEP
# Paper:Comparison of Different Computing Platforms for Implementing Parallel Genetic Programming

The implements of three parallel GPs which is based on MPI, GPU, Spark.    

MPI-GP uses C language, you should install and configure the MPI environment to run.  
GPU-GP uses Cuda C language, you should install and configure the Cuda environment to run.  
Spark-GP uses Java language, you should install and configure the Spark and Hadoop environment to run.  

During the experiments, our codes are running in windows (win10) system.
